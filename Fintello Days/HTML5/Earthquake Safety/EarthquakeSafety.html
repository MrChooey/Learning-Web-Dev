                <p>An earthquake is a sudden, rapid shaking of the ground caused by the shifting of 
                  rocks deep underneath the earth’s surface. Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological 
                  faults but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts,
                  and nuclear tests. These can range in size from those that are so weak that they
                   cannot be felt to those violent enough to propel objects and people into the air, 
                   and wreak destruction across entire cities. Earthquakes can cause fires, tsunamis, 
                  landslides or avalanches.  </p>

              <div class="col-lg-6 text-left">
                <p> All of us need to take a role in helping protect each other in the event of an emergency. More than 82% of residents are aware that emergency preparedness is important
                    to handle disasters. Yet of these, most have made little, if any, actual preparations.
                    What about you? Are you ready? Prepare an emergency plan and learn
