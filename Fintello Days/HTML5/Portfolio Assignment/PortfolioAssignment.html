			<div style="padding-top: 40px; color: rgb(247, 236, 255);">
				<h1 style="font-size: 28px;">THE LIFE CYCLE OF AN ANIME FAN</h1>

			</div>

			<div class="text-left display1" style="color: rgb(230, 206, 250); margin-top: 60px;">
				<h1 style="padding-top: 10px; font-size: 24px;">Stage 1: The Awakening</h1>
				<p style="font-size: 18px;" class="text-justify">This lesser developed mind of an
				infant anime fan causes a period of blissful ignorance in which every anime they
				watch is immediately a 10/10. As they have not seen everything, everything is good.
				And this triggers a desire to consume as much anime as they can. Awakening the
				temporary power of time dilation. Where they can seemingly consume 150 episodes of
				anime a day with ease even though it literally shouldn't be physically possible. </p>
			</div>

				<h1 style="padding-top: 10px; font-size: 24px;">Stage 2: Hentai Puberty</h1>
				<p style="font-size:  18px;" class="text-justify">At this stage there is a small realization that
				they can find anime characters "attractive." All those scenes of sexualized anime girls they used to
				find weird slowly start becoming acceptable. Specimens of the female gender may go through an extra
				stage here known as "Yaoi Menstruation." A sudden awakening of a sixth-sense causing them to gravitate
				towards any and all sources of male homosexuality.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="display1 text-left" style="margin-top: 40px; color:rgb(230, 206, 250);">
				<h1 style="padding-top: 15px; font-size: 24px;">Stage 3: Taste</h1>
				<p style="font-size: 18px;" class="text-justify">This will signify a maturity in the life cycle. Allowing
				for interactions within their kind as the comparable level of one's taste excrements is the main form of
				communication within the species. This is when they start to learn what appeals to them and started lining
				themselves with certain factions.</p>

				<h1 style="padding-top: 15px; font-size: 24px;">Stage 4: Merchandise</h1>
				<p style="font-size: 18px;" class="text-justify">While the idea of spending money on anime trinkets may
				have seemed "alien" before, once their merchandise virginity is taken, there's no looking back. What starts
				as a small purchase of a cool poster gradually leads to bigger and bigger purchases before eventually
				selling their left kidney on the black market to order that limited edition human sized Rem figure. If
				they ever reach this stage, it is highly advised that they stay away from anime conventions. As this rare
				event allows the user to temporarily break their limiters to become an unstoppable spending machine.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="display1 text-left" style="margin-top: 40px; color: rgb(230, 206, 250);">
				<h1 style="padding-top: 10px; font-size: 24px;">Stage 5: The First Love</h1>
				<p style="font-size: 18px;" class="text-justify">At some point, the individual may find that a character makes
				them feel something special. The species themselves refer to this character as a waifu or husbando. As with
				love within the human species, the first love for an anime fan will rarely be their last. Some may find one
				they stick with forever, and some will just abandon ship every season depending on which girl is most moe
				like the unfaithful gits that they are.</p>

				<h1 style=" padding-top: 15px; font-size: 24px;">Stage 6: The Seasonal Anime Arms Race</h1>
				<p style="font-size: 18px;" class="text-justify">Here they enter a perpetual cycle of consumption where
				the main objective is to spend every waking hour farming as much anime as humanly possible for that current
				season under the pretense that they need to keep up to date with the current overall conversation
				surrounding anime. At this stage, they are truly tested on their mental fortitude. Any title of two years
				get transported to a seperate realm, unreachable of the current knowledge of physics, known as "The Plan
				to Watch List."
			</div>

			<div class="display1 text-left" style="margin-top: 40px; color: rgb(230, 206, 250)">
				<h1 style=" padding-top: 15px; font-size: 24px;">Stage 7: The Higher State of Being</h1>
				<p style="font-size: 18px;" class="text-justify">Once enough anime has been watched, many can begin to
				feel knowledgeable enough to start understanding anime on a deeper level. Their archenemy becomes their
				former selves, the tasteless casual. And things start surprising them less and less. Eventually, they
				don't even know if they enjoy anime anymore, but what they do know is everyone else is enjoying it wrong.

			<div class="display1 text-left" style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 30px; color: rgb(230, 206, 250)">
				<h1 style=" padding-top: 0px; font-size: 24px;">Final Stage: Acceptance</h1>
				<p style="font-size: 18px;" class="text-justify">At this most mature points in their lifecycle, an anime fan
				will come to accept who they really are and enter a rebirth having achieved oneness with their self identity.
				Sure they could watch every season, sure they could break down why the works of Masaaki Yuasa are revolutionary
				to the medium, sure they've seen the obscure shows that go under appreciated by everyone, but sometimes you just
				got to watch some stupid harem fanservice trash with a tsundere love interest that you grew up loving and enjoy
				the hell out of it because you know what -- that's completely okay. While we refer to this final stage as
				true acceptance, anime fans may know it as a better term, "No longer giving a fuck." This is when they finally
				realize they have ended up exactly on the path they began, back at their awakening with the same shitty taste. As
				the final revolution is to regress back to their infancy.</p>
